 # HTML 5 (Hypertext Markup Language)
## Introduction
* HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages
* HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
* HTML is not a case-sensitive
## HTML Documents
- All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- The HTML document itself begins with `<html>` and ends with `</html>`
- The visible part of the HTML document is between `<body>` and `</body>`
## !DOCTYPE Declaration
- The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly and is not case sensitive
- It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags)
## HTML Headings
- HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags
- `<h1>` defines the most important heading
- `<h6>` defines the least important heading

## HTML Paragraphs
- HTML paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag
```
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>  
```
## HTML Links
- HTML links are defined with the `<a>` tag:
```
<a href="https://www.yahoo.com">This is a link</a>
```
- The link's destination is specified in the `href` attribute. 
- Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements

## HTML Images
- HTML images are defined with the `<img>` tag
- The source file (`src`), alternative text (`alt`), `width`, and `height` are provided as attributes
```
<img src="imagename.jpg" alt="it is a earth image" width="104" height="142">

```

## How to View HTML Source
### View HTML Source Code:
- Right-click in an HTML page and select "View Page Source" (in Chrome) or "View Source" (in Edge), or similar in other browsers. This will open a window containing the HTML source code of the page.

### Inspect an HTML Element:
- Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" to see what elements are made up of (you will see both the HTML and the CSS). You can also edit the HTML or CSS on-the-fly in the Elements or Styles panel that opens
